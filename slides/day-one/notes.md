# General

pre-combine slide decks that will be delivered at the same time! (if it is possible)

## Introduction-slides.pdf

- the slide deck looked really long at first glance, but it's actually something I think you can get through in 10 minutes.

- maybe cut down or eliminate some of the heavier sections like:
- "Userspace is usually found in a couple of different locations and the loccation varies by Linux distribution. In Ubuntu, which is the Linux distribution we will be using, it is predominately found in the /usr and /home directories." --> "Userspace is found in a couple of different locations. In Ubuntu it is predominately found in /usr and /home." this cuts out a lot of stuff you can just say, or don't need to include if you don't want to include it.

## Bash Introduction

there is some duplication between this and the previous slide deck (GNU, terminal emulator, terminal) these can probably be cut, or at least significantly cut down since the ground was covered in the previous slide deck.

Some of these slides were vertical slides in slides.js --> you may want to reduce them to one additional slide since they can't be entirely skipped. for example:

Bash Shell Variables should be its own slide, but then the next slide can be Bash Shell Variable Examples and can contain $BASH, $HOME, $PATH all in the same slide -- it will cut down on the length of the slide deck

## Streams Redirection & Pipes

- pretty good overall, maybe add to Standard Input since that slide is light.
