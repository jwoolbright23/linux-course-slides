# Kickoff

## Intro

- I'm sure you will, but make sure you give more information about your bullet points on the Introduction slide (how did the course change from when you took it, what have you been working on since becoming a technical curriculum dev?)

## What is this course?

- move bullet point one (about asynchronous consumption to the end) tell them about the class before telling them how it can be consumed

## Where does it lead?

- make sure to mention they will likely be able to deploy **their final project** to a server

- "I hope to be able to cover some of the above as additional/bonus content towards the end of the 5 day schedule!" -- let them know LC is in the process of creating additional curriculum around these points -- if you are comfortable let them know you are happy to answer questions about some of those additional topics with free time in the course

## What is expected of you?

- maybe after this slide (or at the end of the deck) give them the configurations links, and walk them through what it will be like, show them your own virtualbox and how to start up an existing machine



Overall it looks great!
